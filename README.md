# pcaps
A collection of pcaps for testing

## Filenames

* If the pcap contains malicious streams, please place it in the appropriate 
subdirectory in the `malicious` directory. 
* For all clean pcaps, place the pcap in the appropriate `layer` directory, and 
prefix them with the appropriate protocol name. 
Example: `dhcp_<something>.pcap`
* Avoid uploading large pcaps
